## About the Data

The analysis uses data from CBOS monthly studies on attitudes towards the economic and political situation in Poland. The dataset includes responses from participants in Warsaw, providing insights into subjective perceptions. It stems from a questionnaire survey conducted on 2021-04-18.

## Research Problem and Analysis

The analysis estimates mean values of responses to the question: "Will the situation in Poland improve, worsen, or stay the same over the next year?" The focus is on variations in attitudes among different demographic groups, including gender and age.

## Conclusions

The analysis reveals interesting insights. Men tend to hold more pessimistic views, irrespective of age. Younger individuals exhibit a more positive outlook, supporting the perception of young people as idealists.

These findings offer valuable insights into attitudes towards the economic and political situation in Poland, shedding light on variations by sex and age.
